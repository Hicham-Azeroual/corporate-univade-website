# Univade Corporate Website

Welcome to the Univade Corporate Website project!  
This is a modern, responsive, and animated landing page built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **PrimeReact**.  
The project demonstrates best practices in component isolation, CSS Modules, animation with GSAP, and scalable design.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **React + Vite**: Fast development and HMR.
- **Component-based architecture**: Each UI section is a reusable, isolated component.
- **CSS Modules**: Styles are scoped to components for maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first global styling and design tokens.
- **PrimeReact**: Ready-to-use UI components (Sidebar, Menu, etc).
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth, performant entrance and background effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices.
- **Easy Theming**: Change colors and fonts in one place using CSS variables.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Animation logic, constants, and styles are all in their own files.
